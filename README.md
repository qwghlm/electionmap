#UK Election Map

This is an old (circa 2005-6) map of the UK election in 2001 and 2005. I don't intend to update it for 2010, but you are more than welcome to. This is written in an old version of Flash (7) and ActionScript 1.0 so it might be out of date or compile with errors. No warranty provided, caveat emptor :)

A working demo is here: http://qwghlm.co.uk/projects/electionmap/
